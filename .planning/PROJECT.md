# mermaid-tw5

## What This Is

A TiddlyWiki 5 plugin that embeds the Mermaid.js diagramming library, enabling users to render flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, Gantt charts, Git graphs, mindmaps, timelines, Sankey diagrams, and more directly inside TiddlyWiki notebooks. The plugin provides both a `<$mermaid>` widget and a dedicated MIME-type parser for seamless integration.

## Core Value

TiddlyWiki users can create and view rich Mermaid diagrams natively within their notebooks without leaving the wiki environment.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ **QUAL-02**: Add automated test suite for widget rendering and parser behavior — validated in Phase 2, v0.5.0
- ✓ **DIST-01**: Pre-built TiddlyWiki demo hosted on GitHub Pages — existing
- ✓ **CLEAN-01**: Remove debug `console.log` statements from production code — validated in Phase 1, v0.5.0
- ✓ **CLEAN-02**: Remove commented-out dead code — validated in Phase 1, v0.5.0

- ✓ **DOCS-02**: Developer setup and contribution guidelines — validated in Phase 5, v0.5.0
- ✓ **UPDT-01**: Upgrade to modern Mermaid.js — validated 2026-04-27; upgraded to Mermaid 11.14.0

### Active

(None — all v1 requirements shipped. Next milestone requirements to be defined.)

### Out of Scope

- **Real-time collaboration** — Not core to a single-user TiddlyWiki plugin
- **Server-side rendering** — Plugin is client-side only by design
- **Custom diagram types beyond Mermaid** — Out of scope; leverage upstream Mermaid
- **Mobile-native app wrapper** — Web-first; mobile browsers are sufficient
- **Multi-user security hardening** — Plugin targets personal notebooks; `securityLevel: 'loose'` is a documented trade-off

## Context

- **Technical environment**: TiddlyWiki 5 plugin architecture with no build pipeline, no npm, no bundler
- **Prior work**: Consolidation of multiple earlier community efforts (gt6796c, jasonmhoule, cedarvera, jceb)
- **Bundle size**: Empty TW 5.3.3 is ~2.4 MB; mermaid 11.14.0 adds ~3.0 MB; lazy loading mitigates impact on non-diagram pages
- **Upstream tracking**: Previously tracked mermaid-js/mermaid#4616 for lite build; no longer blocking as full bundle was adopted
- **Maintenance model**: Single maintainer (E Furlan), infrequent updates, automated CI/CD now in place
- **Fragile areas**: WikiText un-parsing (`getScriptBody`) described by original author as "twitchy difficult to maintain and buggy"
- **Current state (post-v0.5.0)**: Mermaid 11.14.0 active, 13 tests passing, lazy loading active, GitHub Actions CI/CD live, developer docs complete

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Must remain compatible with TiddlyWiki 5 module system; no npm/build tools introduced without strong justification
- **Bundle size**: Plugin overhead is now ~3.0 MB for Mermaid alone; mitigated by lazy loading on non-diagram pages
- **Compatibility**: Must work in both browser and Node.js TiddlyWiki environments
- **Dependencies**: Mermaid.js and D3.js are vendored; updates require manual verification

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Upgrade to Mermaid 11.14.0 | Bundle size accepted (~3.0 MB) in exchange for 10+ new diagram types: mindmap, timeline, Sankey, XY chart, quadrant, block, architecture, kanban, packet, radar, Wardley maps, treeview, ishikawa. Lazy loading mitigates non-diagram page impact. | ✓ Good — expanded diagram catalog significantly |
| `securityLevel: 'loose'` | Required for clickable diagram interactions within TiddlyWiki | ✓ Good — documented trade-off for personal notebooks |
| Inline rocklib (v0.3.5) | Remove external dependency on `$:/plugins/orange/mermaid-tw5/widget-tools.js` | ✓ Good — reduced fragility from external plugin dependency |
| D3 zoom via click toggle | Enables pan/zoom without complex UI chrome | ⚠️ Revisit — unconventional UX pattern |
| Lazy loading of mermaid.js and D3.js | Defer library loading until first diagram render; pages without diagrams save ~3.0 MB + D3 overhead | ✓ Good — essential given modern Mermaid size |
| Stay on Mermaid 9.3.0 | Previous decision: measured v10.9.0=3.34 MB, v11.14.0=3.16 MB, tiny=2.12 MB; all exceeded 1.5 MB deferral threshold. | — Overridden 2026-04-27: bundle size accepted for new diagram types |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
